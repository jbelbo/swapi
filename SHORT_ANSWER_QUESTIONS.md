#### 1 - What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make us the right next step in your career?

I'm looking for a role at a growing, product-focused company where I can have a meaningful impact on the end-user experience. LawnStarter stands out to me because of its strong presence in the consumer space — I’m excited about the opportunity to build products that people interact with daily, especially in a business like yours that blends ecommerce and real-world services.

I’m also looking for a place where I can continue to grow as an engineer, with the potential to take on more leadership responsibilities over time — whether that’s mentoring others, leading projects, or eventually stepping into a formal lead role. From what I’ve seen so far, LawnStarter feels like the right mix of challenge, ownership, and growth potential.


#### 2 - What have you learned so far about us that has excited you?

What’s excited me most is LawnStarter’s growth beyond just lawn care into other home service verticals. That kind of expansion shows you're not just maintaining — you’re innovating and scaling. It’s exciting to think about the engineering challenges that come with supporting multiple service types, optimizing user experience across them, and building flexible systems that can evolve with the business.

That momentum, combined with the chance to work on a product that impacts people’s everyday lives, makes LawnStarter feel like a really energizing place to be right now.


#### 3 - Have you worked in an environment where developers own delivering features all the way to production? Are you comfortable going to a place where the quality buck stops with the engineers and you have the ability to deploy and observe your own code in production?

Yes, absolutely. In my previous roles, I’ve owned features end-to-end — from initial design and implementation to writing automated tests, validating in staging, and deploying to production.

I also built a custom Datadog dashboard to monitor key metrics and errors, along with Slack notifications to alert me immediately if anything went wrong post-deploy. That kind of ownership keeps the feedback loop tight and helps build better, more reliable software.

So yes — I’m very comfortable in an environment where engineers are responsible for quality and are empowered to ship and support their code in production.


#### 4 - What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?

I’m really interested in diving deeper into React Native. I’ve worked with React on the web, but building mobile apps that share logic and components across platforms is something I’d love to get more hands-on with.

More broadly, I’m always looking to grow in areas that help build more reliable and scalable systems — like observability tooling, domain-driven design, or designing software to support multiple verticals, which I imagine is a big part of what you’re doing at LawnStarter.
